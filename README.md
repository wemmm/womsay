![WomSay](https://github.com/wemmm/womsay/blob/master/womsay.gif)

This is an experiment to find out about making Ruby gems, in the form of a CL generator that bestows the user with annoying in-jokes from [Wem](https://github.com/wemmm) and [Dom](https://github.com/dmcd84) (collectively Wom). It works rather similarly to [Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)).

## Installation

Clone this repo and navigate to it via the command line, then:


```bundle install```


```chmod +x exe/womsay``` - this adds the womsay command.



## Usage

Type ```womsay``` in the terminal to recieve a womsaying.

## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
